Crazyflie_demo
==============

A repo to hold demos of the Crazyflie Python library


How To
======

There are two ways of running these scripts. Either add the lib directory of the Crazyflie PC Client to your PYTHONPATH environment variable:
export PYTHONPATH="~/cfclient-2013.4.1/lib/":$PYTHONPATH

Or just put the scripts into the lib/ directory itself.


The Crazyflie PC Client repo and the python library these scripts depend on can be found here:

https://bitbucket.org/bitcraze/crazyflie-pc-client


You'll probably need most of the normal client requirements installed first.


The reason I started this repo was because I didn't have a controller to use at first and I wanted to see if I could get it flying without one. This isn't doable yet... but maybe soon it will be!
