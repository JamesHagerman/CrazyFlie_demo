Crazyflie_demo
==============

A repo to hold demos of the Crazyflie Python library


How To
======

To use these scripts, I had to place them in the lib/ directory of the Crazyflie PC Client repo that you can get from here:

https://bitbucket.org/bitcraze/crazyflie-pc-client

This is probably wrong but at least you can access the library files you need from that directory. I'll change this later once I figure out a "better" way of loading the libraries.

Once the script is in lib, chmod +x the script itself and run the script. You'll probably need all of the normal client requirements installed first.

The reason I started this repo was because I didn't have a controller to use at first and I wanted to see if I could get it flying without one. This isn't doable yet... but maybe soon it will be!
